Code for the paper ''Deep-learning domain adaptation techniques for credit cards fraud detection''
See this preprint for reference : ADD A LINK TO PREPRINT

Code will be available on Friday 02/11/18 (01/11/18 is holiday in Belgium !)

The data we used are under NDA in collaboration with Worldline SA/NV (https://be.worldline.com/content/worldline-be/en/home.html).
