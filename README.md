The data we used are under NDA in collaboration with Worldline SA/NV (https://be.worldline.com/content/worldline-be/en/home.html).
If you are interested, an anonymized, rather similar (but not equivalent), version of our data is available here :

Sadly, those data contains only e-commerce transactions: It is therefore not possible to use it to mimic face-to-face data.
For any purpose, we included a toy example of a few fictional data.

The code for method AugDNN in a Jupyter notebook (see the paper) is available in AugDNN.ipynb.

The code for method AdvDNN in a Jupyter notebook (see the paper) is available in AdvDNN.ipynb.

This work was supported by the Defeat Frauds project funded by Innoviris (2017-R-49a). We thank this institution for giving us the opportunity to conduct both fundamental and applied research. B. Lebichot also thanks LouRIM, Universite catholique de Louvain, Belgium for their support.
